    "This notebook showcases how to use  `PASEOS` to simulate **Sentinel2-B (S2B)**. In particular, the notebook shows how to create `space_actors` orbiting as the **S2B** around Earth. In addition, it shows how to add a `power` device and demonstrates how to register activities to perform onboard data acquisition and processing to detect **volcanic eruptions** on `Sentinel-2 L1C data`. <br> **DISCLAIMER**: the notebook requires `rasterio` and `scikit-image` to run correctly, which is not included in the packets required to install `PASEOS`. To install `rasterio` you can use: <br><center>  ```conda install -c conda-forge rasterio``` or alternatively ```pip install rasterio``` </center>\n",

To this aim, we will use `detection of volcanic eruptions` as use case, assuming it will be possible to run it onboard `S2B`. <br>We exploit a simplified version of the algorithm `[1]`, which leverages the spectral bands `B8A`, `B11` and `B12` to create a binary-map containing pixels marked as thermal anomalies. To detect the volcanic eruptions, we cluster those pixels in bounding boxes and return their coordinates to simulate an alert creation. <br> We will assume `S2B` will acquire images and then process them by using [1]. In this notebook, we assume to be able to detect the following images regardless of their proper geographical position. We thank the `ESA` project `Sentinel2_L0` for providing images and the implementation of [1]. <br>\n",
