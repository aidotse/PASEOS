""" This example showcases how you can run PASEOS on a high-performance computing infrastructure
using MPI (see also https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html).

Please run the example with mpiexec -n 4 python mpi_example.py

In the example, we model four satellites in low-Earth orbit that are only very infrequently in
line of sight of each other. For simplicity, the modelled task here will be to count the number of
window encounters for each satellite. 

N.B. There are some simplifications in this example. Running this on a compute cluster / supercomputer
you would want to minimize communications between ranks further. For clarity, we stay simple.
For details on the MPI parts also have a look at the mpi_utility_func.py in this folder.

# Let's start by importing the required packages, in addition to PASEOS' requirements
# we also need mpi4py (install via conda install mpi4py -c conda-forge )
